# stumblingBlocks


1. autcomplete bold letters that match.

I couldn't figure out how to get this function to work.
I attempted a for loop that would use a css class that would bold text if input box value matched datalist. Didn't work out so I decided to move on to the next project, Shopper's Delight.

I had the most trouble getting my shopping cart to display properly. If I have my total cost function and my item in cart function appended to the same parent, it doesn't display properly. I also tried putting them in different parents but in the same <section>, still had the same issue. The only way I could get them to display properly is to have one function displayed in the footer and the other function displayed in the header. Weird,

I think my most serious stumbling block that slows me down on every project is organizing my thoughts. I have so many different ideas but I don't know how to sort through them effeciently. I have trouble writing out what I'm trying to accomplish. I'm trying to change that but it's been a challenge. I feel like if I can figure out how to do this that it will not only make my coding more efficient, but it might also drastically make my life better.
